# ML_naive_bayes
Manual Multinomial and Bernoulli Naive Bayes Impl√©mentation

This project explores the implementation and evaluation of Naive Bayes classifiers for two datasets: a Golf dataset and the Tweet Evaluation dataset. The Golf dataset predicts whether golf will be played based on binary and categorical features, utilizing the Bernoulli Naive Bayes classifier. The Tweet Evaluation dataset performs sentiment analysis on tweets, classifying them into emotional categories using the Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier, which is well-suited for text data. 

The project includes both manual and `scikit-learn` implementations of Naive Bayes models, with detailed preprocessing steps such as one-hot encoding for the Golf dataset and text cleaning for the Tweet Evaluation dataset. Metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score are reported for both manual and library-based models, comparing their performance. The study emphasizes the strengths of each Naive Bayes variant in handling binary and multiclass data, highlighting their applicability to different problem domains.
